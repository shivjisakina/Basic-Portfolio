	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>My name is Sakina Shivji. I was born in Dubai, and grew up in Minnesota. After leaving Minnesota, I went to Oman and Qatar for 5 years each. </p>
	<p>Ive been interested in technology since I was young, and having family members in the tech field made it easier for me to choose what I wanted to do. I started working for my brothers web development company when I was 13 as a Social Media Manager, and left when I turned 17 to focus on school. Im excited to get back into it and learn everything about programming!</p>
